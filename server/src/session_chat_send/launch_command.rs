/// The test for a start command left at the shell prompt (GitHub #290: a new chat switched to Codex showed `codex` typed but not run, and the keys that followed landed in the shell). Whitespace is ignored because a long line wraps across screen rows. An agent's start line runs to kilobytes, so the screen may show only part of it: zsh's line editor draws a line taller than the screen from its start and leaves the rest undrawn (seen live with a 2.6 KB Codex line), while a terminal echoing typeahead scrolls the start away. So the command waits when the screen shows its start followed by nothing but more of it, or its end followed by nothing but a few keys echoed in caret notation. Only a copy the screen did not show before the command was typed counts: a switch made twice left the first copy on screen, which read as this one having run.

After the Enter, this waits until the command holds the terminal or the agent runs. If the shell is back at its line editor with the command still the last thing on screen, it presses Enter once; if the prompt is bare and the command is gone, it types it once more. A shell still in line mode (loading its startup files) already holds the typed line and is left alone, because a second Enter would reach the agent that line starts. A command that still sits unrun after that fails the sequence with the reason.
