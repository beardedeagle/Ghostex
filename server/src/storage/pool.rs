/// CDXC:ServerDaemon 2026-10-23 WHY:
/// Every storage call used to open its own connection: a file open, three PRAGMA round trips, a fresh parse of the whole schema on the first statement and a cold page cache, paid several times a second by the background tasks and once per open chat per second by the chat follower's live-state read. Connections now return to a small pool when the borrower drops them, so a call reuses an open connection whose schema, page cache and cached statements are already warm. A connection that comes back inside an open transaction is closed instead of pooled, and each borrow resets the busy timeout, the only per-connection setting callers change.
