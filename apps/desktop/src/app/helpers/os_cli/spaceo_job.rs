/// CDXC:ManagedTools 2026-10-01 WHY:

Running it as SpaceO's own `com.spaceo.daemon` LaunchAgent gives it one stable identity to grant once, the role CuaDriver.app plays for Trycua. When the LaunchAgent already exists, an update drains the daemon (`daemon restart --operator` waits for running sessions to end) and launchd starts the new build; otherwise any hand-started daemon is stopped before the LaunchAgent takes its socket.
